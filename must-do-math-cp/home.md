# 	📢Must Do Math For Competitive Programmers📢

If it is your target to be a competitive programmer, then you must learn the following topics. Because these topics will directly help you in competitive programming. So many problems of competitive programming can be solved easily if you have the idea of these topics:

- 👉 BigInteger
- 👉 GCD, LCM, Euclidean Algorithm, Extended Euclidean Algorithm
- 👉 Sieve of Eratosthenes & Segment Sieve
- 👉 Modular Arithmetic, Modular Exponentiation, Modular Multiplicative Inverse
- 👉 The Chinese Remainder Theorem
- 👉 Lucas Theorem
- 👉 Series & Sequences
- 👉 Catalon Number
- 👉 The Pigeonhole Principal
- 👉 The Inclusion Exclusion Principal

If you know the basic concepts of these topics and if you can master yourself in using these theorems to solve problems, then you will do better in competitive programming.

Thank you. You can learn these topics from the internet or any book. I will give their links or necessary documents very soon.

**Happy Coding!**
