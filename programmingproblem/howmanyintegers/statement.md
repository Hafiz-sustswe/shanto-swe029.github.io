# How Many Integers Are There?

***

[`See Solution`](https://shanto-swe029.github.io/programmingproblem/howmanyintegers/solution)

## Problem Statement

    Shanto loves numbers. His friend Mehraj loves coding. So one day Shanto challanged 
    Mehraj that if Shanto gives Mehraj a line consisting of several integers, can Mehraj 
    write a code to find out how many integers are there? But you know what? Mehraj is 
    very busy these days. So he asks you to write the code for him.

## Input

    In the first line of the input, you will be given a positive integer T (T <= 100000) 
    denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines will contain one or more 
    positive or negative integers seperated by one or more spaces. The absolute value of 
    each of the numbers will be not more than 100000000. N.B: The lines can contain 
	leading spaces.

## Output

	  Print a number N, in each of the T lines, denoting the number of integers in that 
	  line.

## Example

    Sample Input-01:
    4
    1  2 -10000   50 20 -7   445
	       9
    98 876  -65
    223   -9876452  212
	
    Sample Output-01:
