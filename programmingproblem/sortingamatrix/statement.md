# Sorting A Matrix

***

## Problem Statement

```
    You will be given two integers n, m. The dimension of the matrix
    will be (n x m). You have to print the matrix in such a way that
    in each row, the elements come in nondecreasing order.

    It is ensured that n, m > 0 and the product of n & m does not
    exceed 10^(6). Each element of the matrix will be in range >>
    [-10^(6), 10^(6)].
```

## Example

    Sample Input
        4 4
        4 3 14 3
        1 2 65 21
        31 31 556 222
        3123 3121 55 41
    Sample Output
        3 3 4 14
        1 2 21 65
        31 31 222 556
        41 55 3121 3123
