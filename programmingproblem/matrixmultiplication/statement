# Matrix Multiplication

***

## Problem Statement

```
    In this problem, you have to multiply two string (if possible)
    and print the resultant product matrix.
```

## Input
```
    In first line you'll be given two integer n1, m1; the dimension
    of the first matrix. Each of the next n1 line will contain m1
    integers. Then in the next line you will be given two integers
    n2, m2; the dimension of the second matrix. Then each of the
    following m2 lines contain m2 integers.
```

## Output

```
    If the multiplication is not possible, print "Not Possible"
    without the quotes. Else in the first line print two space
    separated integers n, m; the dimension of the result matrix.
    Then print n lines, each consisting of m integers, which 
    denotes the resultant matrix.
```

## Example

    Sample Input
        2 2
        1 -1
        0 2
        2 3
        1 3 0
        2 0 1
    Sample Output
        2 3
        -1 3 -1
        4 0 2
